Due to other module lectures and assignments, as well as moving home for Christmas,
I was unable to successfully implement all of the project requirements.
However the main tasks of Joining, Indexing, Hashing etc have been compiled and tested.
Searching, Ping and ACK implementations are also included although not fully functional 
as time constraints again interrupted debugging and testing.
